## 📄 Overview
This machine learning project predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical attributes. It uses a **Logistic Regression** model to classify patients into two categories:
* **1:** Defective Heart (Disease)
* **0:** Healthy Heart (No Disease)

## 📊 Dataset
The model relies on `heart_disease_data.csv`, which contains medical details such as:
* Age, Sex
* Chest Pain Type (cp)
* Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
* Cholesterol (chol)
* Fasting Blood Sugar, etc.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** * `pandas` (Data Manipulation)
    * `numpy` (Numerical Operations)
    * `sklearn` (Model Building & Evaluation)
    * `seaborn` & `matplotlib` (Data Visualization)

## 📈 Model Performance
The model was trained using **Logistic Regression** with a train-test split of 80/20.
